### Excellia UI Code

## Currently, the CourseTest Branch is the one which is  deployed to firebase because we are developing some functions in it. So, it's our final version deployed in the firebase. 

This is the UI code with the functions supporting the movement in the interface. 

To deploy it to firebase, you have to make the "npm run build" command. Then, "firebase deploy" using our credentials for firebase. 

This directory contains all the frontpage resourses like homepage, profile page, post body, sign up and login page.
